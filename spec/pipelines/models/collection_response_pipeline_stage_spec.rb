#CRM Pipelines

#Pipelines represent distinct stages in a workflow, like closing a deal or servicing a support ticket. These endpoints provide access to read and modify pipelines in HubSpot. Pipelines support `deals` and `tickets` object types.  ## Pipeline ID validation  When calling endpoints that take pipelineId as a parameter, that ID must correspond to an existing, un-archived pipeline. Otherwise the request will fail with a `404 Not Found` response.
