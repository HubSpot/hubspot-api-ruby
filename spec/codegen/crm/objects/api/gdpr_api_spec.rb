#CRM Objects

#CRM objects such as companies, contacts, deals, line items, products, tickets, and quotes are standard objects in HubSpotâ€™s CRM. These core building blocks support custom properties, store critical information, and play a central role in the HubSpot application.  ## Supported Object Types  This API provides access to collections of CRM objects, which return a map of property names to values. Each object type has its own set of default properties, which can be found by exploring the [CRM Object Properties API](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/crm-properties/crm-properties-overview).  |Object Type |Properties returned by default | |--|--| | `companies` | `name`, `domain` | | `contacts` | `firstname`, `lastname`, `email` | | `deals` | `dealname`, `amount`, `closedate`, `pipeline`, `dealstage` | | `products` | `name`, `description`, `price` | | `tickets` | `content`, `hs_pipeline`, `hs_pipeline_stage`, `hs_ticket_category`, `hs_ticket_priority`, `subject` |  Find a list of all properties for an object type using the [CRM Object Properties](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/crm-properties/get-properties) API. e.g. `GET https://api.hubapi.com/properties/v2/companies/properties`. Change the properties returned in the response using the `properties` array in the request body.
